# dummy-api

This is a simple Express.js backend created for testing purposes.  
It provides a minimal setup to experiment with routes, middleware, and server behavior.

A basic API route is included that responds with sample user data when accessed via a GET request â€” useful for learning how APIs work or testing frontend requests.
